# RidePare
RidePare is our attempt to improve mobility efficiency, accessibility and sustainability in our community by providing fare and journey information for various rideshare programs (currently Uber, Lyft, Lime Scooters and CitiBikes) so that users can make the best choice for them! RidePare makes daily life more efficient by providing users with fare and journey information in a layout that makes services easily comparable, so you can quickly make a decision that might have taken much longer before. RidePare also help make rideshare services more accessible to lower-income communities by lowering the barrier for accessing pricing information so that you can review if the journey makes financial sense for you! Finally, RidePare promotes a more sustainable future, as encouraging the use of rideshare programs helps save our planet!
